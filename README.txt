Project by Alex Medos

Project should run in Debug mode, x86 configuration

Functions exactly the same as project 1.

There's a file called EntityDetails which specifies what objects are placed in the scene, and where.
It should create 10 spheres, but more can be added by adding new object descriptions to the file,
as well as increasing the number at the top (which indicates how many objects the file is creating)
Most notable are the Position value, which places the spheres in the scene,
and the Scale value, which dictates the sphere's radius and mass.

Controls:

Up / Down Arrows: Zoom the camera in and out from the scene

WASD - Apply force on the selected sphere

Space - Changes the selected sphere. Camera focuses on the selected sphere,
	and it's the only sphere in the scene that will have colour

Thanks, and have fun.
